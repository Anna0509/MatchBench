**We make significant changes in the new version of the paper which will come soon.**

## Introduction

**There exists a "ReadMe.txt" for describing the data and code in each folder.**

Requirements:

	1. Matlab (Evaluate results and plot figures)
	2. OpenCV (Run feature matching algorithms)
 
Dataset:
	
	1. Download the all subsets from the project page (https://jwbian.net/matchbench) and put them in the folder "Dataset".
	2. The data format is described in "ReadMe.txt".
    
Algorithms:
	
	1. Many feature matchers are provided.
	2. The Matlab script for running algorithms are given.
    
Evaluation:
	
	You can use the code in this folder to plot figures as presented in the paper.
