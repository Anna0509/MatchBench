## Introduction

**There exist a "ReadMe.txt" for describing the data and code in each folder.**

Requirements:

	1. Matlab (Evaluate results and plot figures)
	2. Ghostscript (Save figures as pdf format)
	3. OpenCV (Run feature matching algorithms)
 
Dataset:
	
	1. Download the all subsets from the project page (https://jwbian.net/benchmark) and put them in the folder "Dataset".
	2. The data format is described in "ReadMe.txt".
    
Algorithms:
	
	1. The code of total 12 feature matchers are provided.
	2. The Matlab script for running algorithms on all subsets are given.
    
Evaluation:
	
	You can use the code in this folder to plot figures as presented in the paper.
